Java Common Libraries Extensions / Language Extensions
======================================================

Language extensions and utilities that are used quite
often but not yet offered by common 3rd party libraries
like Apache Commons Lang or Google Guava.

This library actually builds on Apache Commons Lang.

Features will be deprecated and removed once they become
available in the aforementioned libraries. Will be extended
if some common functionality comes along that is not 
yet available.

Suggestions welcome.
